# Weather Data Analysis and Visualization

Project Documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mx_qGRsQUyuWTqHC17Ub8YSaYts8m-8bIEt_Z1E_5so/edit?usp=sharing

Objective:
Develop a Python program to analyze and visualize weather data. This project will help you
understand data manipulation, working with external libraries, and basic data visualization
techniques.
Requirements:
1. Python Knowledge: Basic understanding of Python syntax, functions, loops, and
conditionals.
2. Libraries: Use Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data
visualization.
Dataset:
You can use any publicly available weather dataset. One such example is the Daily Global
Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily) dataset, which contains daily weather
observations from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Steps:
1. <b>Data Collection:</b> Download a weather dataset or access it through an API.
2. <b>Data Cleaning and Preparation:</b>
  Load the data using Pandas.
  Clean the data by handling missing values, erroneous entries, and data types.
3. <b>Data Analysis:</b>
  Calculate statistical summaries like mean, median, mode, minimum, and
maximum temperature.
  Analyze more complex patterns like seasonal changes or yearly trends in
  temperature or precipitation.

4. <b>Data Visualization:</b>
  Create line graphs to show temperature changes over time.
  Use bar charts to compare average monthly rainfall or temperatures.
  Optional: Create more complex visualizations like heatmaps or geographical
plots if the dataset includes location data.

5. <b>Interpretation:</b> Write a brief report interpreting the results of your analysis and
visualizations. Discuss any interesting trends or patterns you observed.

Deliverables:
1. Python Code: A well-documented Python script that performs data cleaning,
analysis, and visualization.
2. Report: A document or a set of slides that summarizes your methodology, findings,
and interpretations of the data.
Advanced Extensions (Optional):
  Perform comparative analysis between different years or locations.
  Use more advanced visualization techniques like interactive plots.
  Implement data fetching through a live API to get real-time weather data.
Learning Outcomes:
  Understand how to manipulate and process data using Pandas.
  Gain experience in visualizing data and interpreting patterns in datasets.
  Learn to document and present findings in a coherent and understandable manner.

This project is designed to be flexible, allowing you to scale the complexity based on your
comfort level with Python and data analysis. It provides a practical application of Python in a
real-world context, enhancing your programming and data science skills.
